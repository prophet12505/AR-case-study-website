            <p>Imagine one day, you would be able to explore a different possibility while shopping for clothes, that
                is—the augmented reality fitting room. Let’s have a look at what it would be like through this short
                video clip:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TEPGgl686-w">(link)</a><br> 
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TEPGgl686-w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                <br>
             
                This AR fitting room equipment is created by FXGear—a Company devoted to developing augmented fitting
                room related services and Products.
                Open your search engine, and type in “AR fitting room”, you would be able to see plenty of related
                products, services, and prototypes from different companies.
                Looks like we are heading into a charming and creative future of augmented reality. But before we enter
                this brand new era, it would be better for us to reconsider if we are making this technology more
                inclusive, less susceptible to the potential hazard, and hospitable/usable to people around the world.

                <h2>Diversity in design media</h2>
                <button><a href="#r2r">Reference of this section</a></button>
            </div>
           
            <p>To start with, Let’s figure out one basic question, that is, to what extent do we include diversity in
                this cutting-edge technology?
                As we all know, diversity plays a significant role in elevating our creativity and innovation in various
                kinds of industries. Besides, it definitely enhances our performance in the workforce and on many other
                occasions.
                When we talk about diversity, what exactly are we talking about? What we can relate to this newly
                developed technology? Usually, we should take these several aspects below into consideration :<fn>[1]</fn>
            <ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li>
                    Cultural diversity
                </li>
                <li>
                    Racial diversity
                </li>
                <li>
                   Religious diversity
                </li>
                <li>
                    Age diversity
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sex / Gender diversity
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sexual orientation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Disability
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In order to find out what factors above are relatively worth noting in this industry, let’s have a check
                at some experiences/opinions that people may have about AR in general and how this virtual fitting-room
                could be experienced.
                There are various ways this experience could be interpreted. Let’s go through 3 cases to have a basic
                understanding.
            </p>
            <h4>CASE 1</h4><p>Augmented Reality could be a teaching tool, a medium to educate people paying attention to diversity. A survey shows that many employers are trying to educate people in an innovative approach to emphasize diversity and equality in the workplace. In some companies, to exemplify, Vantage Point, has used VR and AR technology to teach over 500 educational institutes and other corporations. Meanwhile, some companies, like PwC and TaleSpin, are using immersive tech to teach their employees how to recognize discrimination scenarios.  <fn>[2]</fn></p>
            <h4>CASE 2</h4><p>Some of the studies are worrying about the potential harm of the development of augmented reality. In a classic scenario, some of the groups with relatively higher social status and wealth might monopoly the VR products, hence it could be detrimental to equality and diversity. Imagine we live in a world in which a small group of people can do some surgery to take advantage of expensive AR implants to enhance their abilities, this could exacerbate the gap between rich and poor. Moreover, it has the possibility to reduce the right of speech of many minorities because of the firm grasp of power by a small group.   <fn>[3]</fn></p>
            <h4>CASE 3</h4><p>Recently, the virtual fitting room is becoming a  new trend. Nowadays, some customers can use real-time virtual fitting-room via software and hardware to see what they would actually look like if they try different clothes, lipsticks, eyeglasses, and so on. However, there’s one concern that bothers customers all the time, which is the privacy issue. Many manufacturers and platforms will gather users’ personal information, which could not only harm the privacy of different users but also lead to the outcome that algorithms only recommend homogeneous products, which is negative to the diversity of our lifestyle. <fn>[4]</fn></p>
            <h3>What about the diversity of the virtual fitting room?</h3>
            <p>After these several cases, we can have a better understanding of the experience that would be presented in this kind of augmented reality media. As a medium, we can use this kind of tool to emphasize and educate the importance of diversity. Meanwhile, we must be vigilant about whether this kind of tool could be harnessed by some small groups. Lastly, it would be better if we can actually address the privacy issues.
                When it comes to the exact case, which is the virtual fitting room, what else should we pay attention to?  According to the diversity criteria above, I think there are some aspects that we should be working on to enhance diversity:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Auto-adjust brightness and light according to the different skin colors to provide a better experience.</li>
            <li>Audio instruction and different color modes for visual impairment people. (At least it should contain both gesture/touch-screen and audio instruction approaches to operate)</li>
            <li>Adjustment for people with different shapes(scaling function for software, bigger screen size for hardware)</li>
            <li>Ask for consent before gathering costumer’s privacy information(including shape statistics)</li>
            <li>Avoid too much animation and mutation of the virtual costume effect.</li>
            <li>Language options and guidance.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Given that Ar is a newly developed tech, most of the virtual fitting rooms(including the one in our exhibition) don’t meet 1,2,3,4 of the above criteria. Some of them offer different language options and have a clear user interface instead of over-saturated effects and animation.
            The lack of diversity may lead to some of the customers finding it disappointing that it never takes them into consideration.

           <h3>Understand different perspectives through social parameters</h3>
           <p>Different people tend to have different perceptions of emerging augmented reality. Hence it’s important to analyze them and make sure we won’t hurt other people’s feelings.
            Before starting, let’s understand some terms for describing characters of different societies/culturals. 
        </p>
        <p>Masculinity/ Femininity: "Countries can be distinguished by the psychological gender which the societies espouse: masculinity and femininity. Masculinity culture has values reflecting emphasis on work goals, assertiveness, and material success, whereas femininity culture has values focusing on quality of life goals, nurturing and modesty".<fn>[5]</fn></p>
        <p>
            Power distance: "Power distance is defined as the degree to which power and inequality are accepted as normal by the individuals of the society. In higher power distance culture, individuals tend to take it for granted that their superiors have more power and accept the status quo. This can be translated that individuals are more relaxed and fun-loving than ones in lower power distance culture, which, in turn, may induce a great demand for hedonic services."
            <fn>[6]</fn>
        </p>
        <p>
            Individualism/ Collectivism & Uncertainty Avoidance: "People from individual culture tend to be motivated by personal preference or needs, whereas people from collectivist culture are more likely to lean toward a socially appropriate manner. Therefore, people from collectivist culture are more likely to conform to and depend on others in group while peoples from individualist culture are more likely to behave according to their own attitude Indeed, word-of-mouth communication will be stronger in collectivist culture than in individualist culture. " 
            After having a grasp of these 3 terms, let’s bring my analysis into the table(the analysis is based on the cultural characteristic and the researches about the relationships between AR and these cultural feature):,<fn>[7]</fn>
