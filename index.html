            <p>Imagine one day, you would be able to explore a different possibility while shopping for clothes, that
                is—the augmented reality fitting room. Let’s have a look at what it would be like through this short
                video clip:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TEPGgl686-w">(link)</a><br> 
                <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TEPGgl686-w">

                <br>
             
                This AR fitting room equipment is created by FXGear—a Company devoted to developing augmented fitting
                room related services and Products.
                Open your search engine, and type in “AR fitting room”, you would be able to see plenty of related
                products, services, and prototypes from different companies.
                Looks like we are heading into a charming and creative future of augmented reality. But before we enter
                this brand new era, it would be better for us to reconsider if we are making this technology more
                inclusive, less susceptible to the potential hazard, and hospitable/usable to people around the world.

                <h2>Diversity in design media</h2>

            </div>
           
            <p>To start with, Let’s figure out one basic question, that is, to what extent do we include diversity in
                this cutting-edge technology?
                As we all know, diversity plays a significant role in elevating our creativity and innovation in various
                kinds of industries. Besides, it definitely enhances our performance in the workforce and on many other
                occasions.
                When we talk about diversity, what exactly are we talking about? What we can relate to this newly
                developed technology? Usually, we should take these several aspects below into consideration :<fn>[1]</fn>
            <ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li>
                    <p>Cultural diversity</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Racial diversity</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Religious diversity</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Age diversity</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Sex / Gender diversity</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Sexual orientation</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Disability</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In order to find out what factors above are relatively worth noting in this industry, let’s have a check
                at some experiences/opinions that people may have about AR in general and how this virtual fitting-room
                could be experienced.
                There are various ways this experience could be interpreted. Let’s go through 3 cases to have a basic
                understanding.
