            <p>Imagine one day, you would be able to explore a different possibility while shopping for clothes, that
                is—the augmented reality fitting room. Let’s have a look at what it would be like through this short
                video clip:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TEPGgl686-w">(link)</a><br> 
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TEPGgl686-w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                <br>
             
                This AR fitting room equipment is created by FXGear—a Company devoted to developing augmented fitting
                room related services and Products.
                Open your search engine, and type in “AR fitting room”, you would be able to see plenty of related
                products, services, and prototypes from different companies.
                Looks like we are heading into a charming and creative future of augmented reality. But before we enter
                this brand new era, it would be better for us to reconsider if we are making this technology more
                inclusive, less susceptible to the potential hazard, and hospitable/usable to people around the world.

                <h2>Diversity in design media</h2>
                <button><a href="#r2r">Reference of this section</a></button>
            </div>
           
            <p>To start with, Let’s figure out one basic question, that is, to what extent do we include diversity in
                this cutting-edge technology?
                As we all know, diversity plays a significant role in elevating our creativity and innovation in various
                kinds of industries. Besides, it definitely enhances our performance in the workforce and on many other
                occasions.
                When we talk about diversity, what exactly are we talking about? What we can relate to this newly
                developed technology? Usually, we should take these several aspects below into consideration :<fn>[1]</fn>
            <ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li>
                    Cultural diversity
                </li>
                <li>
                    Racial diversity
                </li>
                <li>
                   Religious diversity
                </li>
                <li>
                    Age diversity
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sex / Gender diversity
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sexual orientation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Disability
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In order to find out what factors above are relatively worth noting in this industry, let’s have a check
                at some experiences/opinions that people may have about AR in general and how this virtual fitting-room
                could be experienced.
                There are various ways this experience could be interpreted. Let’s go through 3 cases to have a basic
                understanding.
            </p>
            <h4>CASE 1</h4><p>Augmented Reality could be a teaching tool, a medium to educate people paying attention to diversity. A survey shows that many employers are trying to educate people in an innovative approach to emphasize diversity and equality in the workplace. In some companies, to exemplify, Vantage Point, has used VR and AR technology to teach over 500 educational institutes and other corporations. Meanwhile, some companies, like PwC and TaleSpin, are using immersive tech to teach their employees how to recognize discrimination scenarios.  <fn>[2]</fn></p>
            <h4>CASE 2</h4><p>Some of the studies are worrying about the potential harm of the development of augmented reality. In a classic scenario, some of the groups with relatively higher social status and wealth might monopoly the VR products, hence it could be detrimental to equality and diversity. Imagine we live in a world in which a small group of people can do some surgery to take advantage of expensive AR implants to enhance their abilities, this could exacerbate the gap between rich and poor. Moreover, it has the possibility to reduce the right of speech of many minorities because of the firm grasp of power by a small group.   <fn>[3]</fn></p>
            <h4>CASE 3</h4><p>Recently, the virtual fitting room is becoming a  new trend. Nowadays, some customers can use real-time virtual fitting-room via software and hardware to see what they would actually look like if they try different clothes, lipsticks, eyeglasses, and so on. However, there’s one concern that bothers customers all the time, which is the privacy issue. Many manufacturers and platforms will gather users’ personal information, which could not only harm the privacy of different users but also lead to the outcome that algorithms only recommend homogeneous products, which is negative to the diversity of our lifestyle. <fn>[4]</fn></p>
            <h3>What about the diversity of the virtual fitting room?</h3>
            <p>After these several cases, we can have a better understanding of the experience that would be presented in this kind of augmented reality media. As a medium, we can use this kind of tool to emphasize and educate the importance of diversity. Meanwhile, we must be vigilant about whether this kind of tool could be harnessed by some small groups. Lastly, it would be better if we can actually address the privacy issues.
                When it comes to the exact case, which is the virtual fitting room, what else should we pay attention to?  According to the diversity criteria above, I think there are some aspects that we should be working on to enhance diversity:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Auto-adjust brightness and light according to the different skin colors to provide a better experience.</li>
            <li>Audio instruction and different color modes for visual impairment people. (At least it should contain both gesture/touch-screen and audio instruction approaches to operate)</li>
            <li>Adjustment for people with different shapes(scaling function for software, bigger screen size for hardware)</li>
            <li>Ask for consent before gathering costumer’s privacy information(including shape statistics)</li>
            <li>Avoid too much animation and mutation of the virtual costume effect.</li>
            <li>Language options and guidance.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Given that Ar is a newly developed tech, most of the virtual fitting rooms(including the one in our exhibition) don’t meet 1,2,3,4 of the above criteria. Some of them offer different language options and have a clear user interface instead of over-saturated effects and animation.
            The lack of diversity may lead to some of the customers finding it disappointing that it never takes them into consideration.

           <h3>Understand different perspectives through social parameters</h3>
           <p>Different people tend to have different perceptions of emerging augmented reality. Hence it’s important to analyze them and make sure we won’t hurt other people’s feelings.
            Before starting, let’s understand some terms for describing characters of different societies/culturals. 
        </p>
        <p>Masculinity/ Femininity: "Countries can be distinguished by the psychological gender which the societies espouse: masculinity and femininity. Masculinity culture has values reflecting emphasis on work goals, assertiveness, and material success, whereas femininity culture has values focusing on quality of life goals, nurturing and modesty".<fn>[5]</fn></p>
        <p>
            Power distance: "Power distance is defined as the degree to which power and inequality are accepted as normal by the individuals of the society. In higher power distance culture, individuals tend to take it for granted that their superiors have more power and accept the status quo. This can be translated that individuals are more relaxed and fun-loving than ones in lower power distance culture, which, in turn, may induce a great demand for hedonic services."
            <fn>[6]</fn>
        </p>
        <p>
            Individualism/ Collectivism & Uncertainty Avoidance: "People from individual culture tend to be motivated by personal preference or needs, whereas people from collectivist culture are more likely to lean toward a socially appropriate manner. Therefore, people from collectivist culture are more likely to conform to and depend on others in group while peoples from individualist culture are more likely to behave according to their own attitude Indeed, word-of-mouth communication will be stronger in collectivist culture than in individualist culture. " 
            After having a grasp of these 3 terms, let’s bring my analysis into the table(the analysis is based on the cultural characteristic and the researches about the relationships between AR and these cultural feature):,<fn>[7]</fn>
        </p>
        <p>After having a grasp of these 3 terms, let’s bring my analysis into the table(the analysis is based on the cultural characteristic and the researches about the relationships between AR and these cultural feature):</p>
         <table>
            <tr><td><h3>Term</h3></td><td><h3>Analysis</h3></td></tr>
            <tr><td><h3>Masculinity/ Femininity</h3></td><td><p>In a culture that has a strong masculinity tendency(for example, Australia, Mexico, Italy ), people tend to have more emphasize on the usefulness of the AR. This could result in focusing on the functionality of this virtual fitting room and others AR technologies. People would expect more functions that suit their basic needs. 
                On the contrary, in a low-masculine society(like Brazil, Singapore,  Taiwan), people focus more on if there’s sufficient “availability of technology support staff”. <fn>[8]</fn></p>
                </td></tr>
            <tr><td><h3>Power distance</h3></td><td><p>People in High power distance countries and cultures(Malaysia, Iraq, Saudi Arabia) are more likely to indulge themselves in these kinds of immersive technologies.
                Meanwhile, the lower power distance countries(for example, Netherlands, German, Finland) are less prone to these “hedonic service”. <fn>[9]</fn></p>
                </td></tr>
            <tr><td><h3>Individualism/ Collectivism & Uncertainty Avoidance:</h3></td><td><p>It is worth noting that people in collectivist society are more willing to use AR to exhibit their historical relics and heritage in spots that serves tourists. However, sometimes a collectivist society is less transparent, which could lead to the distrust and unnerving about this newly developed technology. The Individualism/Collectivism index has much stronger impact of the willingness to use AR than others indexes. <fn>[10]</fn></p></td></tr>
         </table>
         <h3>My perception--From my Country</h3>
         <p>In China, AR and VR technology is sometimes perceived negatively especially when it relates to recreation. Some of the elder generations think that over-immersion in these virtual technologies would lead to less ambition in real-life success. Also, society has a strong tendency to demonize any recreation like video games. As a predominantly collectivist society, we tend to focus on working hard for the benefit of the whole society instead of entertaining ourselves individually. But also, it depends. People in the southeastern provinces/cities(for example, Shanghai) are more open-minded to AR. <br>
            We do have employed some AR tech though, mainly in the house renting software, map application, and tik-tok.<br>
            In contrast, China is extremely advanced in Artificial Intelligence which can benefits production and control/supervise the citizens.<br>

         </p>
         <h3>Solutions for the variance of different culture:</h3>
         <p>
            First and foremost, the popularity and exposure rate of AR is the key to solve these issues. The more people focus on these kinds of media, the more solutions will be raised to tackle these cultural variances. Meanwhile, there’ll be less bias in this industry.</p><p>

            Second, I think we should have an industry standard for AR and its ramification(A lot of forums/blogs have mentioned the significance of industry standards).<fn>[11]</fn></p><p>
            Third, in my opinion, AR should always be just a choice, not a compulsory one. We should give our customers more choices. For example, the customers are allowed to use both physical fitting room and virtual fitting room app/hardware in a shopper mall. One day, if the AR tech is so predominant that we don’t even have an alternative, for example, there isn’t a physical fitting room in a costume shop just to save space, that is the time we should reconsider and emphasize this principle.</p>

            <h3>Summary of the experience of different visual impairments:</h3>
            <p>There are different kinds of visual impairments. Each of them has a distinctive feeling. As for various color blindness, the best solution is to increase the color contrast to make them recognizable and comfortable to distinguish. When it comes to slightly blurred vision(due to myopia/farsightedness/aging), we can address it using bigger fonts and scaling up. And for severely blurred vision, we can embed audio instructions into our system.</p>
            <h3>How many bias are people suffering while experiencing AR?</h3>
            <h4>What could actually be happening if the virtual fitting room and other AR technology comes into our daily life? Will there be any bias toward different groups affect by the experience of our usage of augmented reality?</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><p>As an International student from China, I can surely say our country has very advanced technology in Artificial Intelligence. And I know that the functionality of a virtual fitting room relies on facial recognition/body recognition and other algorithms of AI. One common concern is, that the machine learning(neuro network) AI model was trained only by the graphic data of one certain kind of race(for example, the Caucasian), which could give rise to the problem that the algorithm cannot recognize other races’ existence in the camera or cannot adjust the virtual accessories properly with different facial feature/body ratio. The same issue could happen in any AR technology when it involves human graphic recognition.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    The same issue could occur in the speech recognition of different accents while using audio instruction to operate the fitting room system, which is caused by the lack of diversity of training data. The same issue could happen in any AR technology when it involves human speech recognition.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    There are some biases towards AR technology itself and the crowds who use AR. Just like we used to have a bias toward video games. Some people may relate crime or other negative events to the AR because it makes people harder to distinguish reality and virtual. This is 100% percent going to happen.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    Online forums/platforms make people gather together, and AR increases its immersive experience. This could also make AR/VR themselves a tool to spread bias, rumor, and hatred across groups on the Internet if AR/VR is taken advantage by extremists.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
             <h3>How to decrease bias overall?</h3>
